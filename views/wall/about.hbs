<h1>Taviloğlu Collection: Half a Century of Adventure</h1>
<p>The collection started by Mustafa Taviloğlu in 1972 with a naive excitement has been growing with great passion and devotion for 52 years.</p>
<p>The collection, which started with penture, has expanded over the years with photography, sculpture, video and installations and has become one of the most important private collections in Turkey. From primitives to Republican period painting, from there to Turkish modernisation and after the 2000s, the collection opened up to contemporary art with works from young artists, offering a glimpse into the history of Turkish art in all its diversity. The collection includes 2412 works in total; 2237 works in various media by 930 Turkish artists, as well as 330 works by 175 foreign artists.</p>
<p>For Taviloğlu, collecting, which he sees as the third pillar of art after artists and institutions, is essential for a balanced art market. This situation also imposes responsibility on collectors. Taviloğlu's collection is the product of personal interest, curiosity and passion. Taviloğlu also sees it as a responsibility to share this interest with the art audience. In 1997, Taviloğlu published Turkey's first private collection book, Turkish Painting, which includes all the works in his collection up to that period, and continues to share his expanding collection.</p>
<p>In addition to its aim of recording and protecting works of art and transferring our cultural heritage to future generations, Taviloğlu Collection plays an active role in making art accessible and increasing the value of art in society.</p>
<p>As an important supporter of the arts in Turkey, Taviloğlu's collection of carefully selected artworks is both impressive and broad in its diversity of artists, periods, styles, techniques and mediums. Mustafa Taviloğlu establishes an objective as well as subjective art history narrative with his collection that he has continued to grow and diversify for half a century.</p>
<h2>A Brief History of the Taviloğlu Collection</h2>
<h3>1972-1982: The First Ten Years of the Collection</h3>
<p>Between the eight-year period from 1972, when Mustafa Taviloğlu first began purchasing, to 1980, he acquired more than 250 paintings. He later described this period as 'I had no intention of becoming a collector,' but this was the beginning of his passionate journey into collecting.</p>
<p>At that time, certain artists regularly exhibited at existing galleries. Yahşi Baraz worked with Edip Hakkı Köseoğlu, while Cumalı Gallery collaborated with names like Cevat Dereli and Ali Çelebi. During these first eight years, when Taviloğlu began forming his collection, he purchased works directly from the artists themselves through personal relationships, after initially buying from private galleries.</p>
<h3>1983-1992</h3>
<p>The 1980s marked the beginning of a new era globally. In these years, socialist parties came to power through elections in many European countries, and nations that had long been deprived of political freedoms began to experience a period of relief. Meanwhile, Turkey faced a military coup during this period. The September 12, 1980 coup marked a new chapter in the history of the Republic of Turkey.</p>
<p>Since the 1970s, criticism had been directed at the state's neglect of museums, which played an essential role in forming the art scene, especially in Istanbul and major cities like Ankara and Izmir. As a result, galleries increasingly took on the task of making art more influential. Private galleries, bank galleries, and other intermediary institutions working to create an art market tried to lay the groundwork for contemporary art during the 1980s, effectively filling a void left by the state. During the 1980s, when private galleries proliferated in Turkey, they made efforts to promote Turkish painting.</p>
<p>At the start of the 1980s, as in 1973-1980, most of the supply in the market was comprised of works by deceased artists, who were among the first names in Western-style Turkish painting. The increase in exhibitions dedicated to the '14 Generation' artists in private galleries is evidence of this trend. As a result, the 1980s art market was characterized by works of deceased artists and pieces that stood out for their older dates.</p>
<p>From the 1980s onwards, as the supply of older works dwindled and prices rose, collectors gradually began to turn their attention to contemporary artists, especially well-known names. The demand for large-scale works to be placed in the expansive spaces of major business centers built during the 1980s also contributed to the spread of contemporary art. The small size of many older works, combined with their high prices, drove demand towards large-scale contemporary pieces.</p>
<p>The years 1980-1982 were when Mustafa Taviloğlu was estranged from Yahşi Baraz and took a break from working with him. Today, he says that one of his biggest regrets was this estrangement, adding, 'I could have bought many more paintings during that period.'</p>
<p>The art market, which began to gain momentum in the second half of the 1970s, was interrupted by social events during the first half of the 1980s. Taviloğlu’s hiatus from purchasing coincided with a period of political and economic turmoil in the country, during which few art activities took place.</p>
<h3>1993-2002</h3>
<p>The art market that emerged in the 1980s began to show interest in contemporary art in the 1990s. The institutionalization of the International Istanbul Biennials, the organization of curated exhibitions, and the Young Events Exhibitions increased attention to young artists and the new generation of artists. The Turkish art scene began to open up internationally in the 1990s. When Rene Block came to Turkey for an event in 1991 and established communication with artists, it significantly contributed to their entry into the international art market.</p>
<p>Until the 1990s, the purchase of classical works had been more prevalent in Turkey. After this period, a saturation point was reached. From these years onwards, there were no more classical and Impressionist paintings left. Only the least successful works of famous painters remained. The emergence of fake paintings on the market created frustration and mistrust, leading people to turn towards contemporary art. This shift allowed artists born in the 1930s to enter the art market. The conditions necessary for the acquisition of contemporary art were established.</p>
<p>In the 2000s, curation, one of the hot topics of the 1990s, became institutionalized, and the collective spirit of the 1990s gave way to individualism. If the 1980s were the formation stages and the 1990s were the stages of claiming this formation, then the 2000s can be described as the stages of institutionalization.</p>
<p>The communication established with foreign countries in the 1990s paved the way for many Turkish artists living abroad to connect with the Istanbul art scene in the 2000s. The 2000s were also when galleries that supported the younger generation opened.</p>
<h3>2003-2012</h3>
<p>The 21st century's first decade in Turkey saw a shift in contemporary art practices towards digital art, video and photography, installation, and performance, becoming more diverse. As contemporary art in Turkey developed in this way, it wasn't until the 2010s that Mustafa Taviloğlu began to incorporate video, installation, and digital photography into his collection. Having collected paintings for thirty years, Taviloğlu was hesitant to start acquiring different art forms. However, over the years, as his eye developed, his confidence in his judgment grew, and after 2010, he began making bolder acquisitions.</p>
<p>In 2011, Mustafa Taviloğlu added his first video art piece to his collection by acquiring Haluk Akakçe’s (1970) 'Coming Home' video. In 2011, he also added video works by Fikret Atay (1976), Ahmet Öğüt (1981), Kerem Ozan Bayraktar (1984), and Özlem Şimşek (1982) to his collection. Later, in 2012, he added works by Bengü Karaduman (1974), Elif Boyner (1985), Nazan Azeri (1953), in 2013; Deniz Bakırcıoğlu, Volkan Kızıltunç (1976), in 2014; Gökçen Dilek Acay (1983) and Erdal İnci (1983), and in 2015; again Elif Boyner, in 2016; Elif Biradlı (1992) and Ergin Soysal’s video works to his collection.</p>
<p>In addition to video art, Taviloğlu also developed an interest in installation art during the 2010s. He added his first installation, Hande Varsat’s 'Dedication to the House Girl,' to his collection and, in the same year, acquired an installation by Ardan Özmenoğlu. In 2011, he also added works by Lebriz Rona (1973), Yıldız Şermet (1970), Borga Kantürk (1978), and Sümer Sayın (1985), in 2013; Pınar & Viola and Hülya Demirtaş, in 2014; Nergiz Yeşil (1988), Özge Topçu (1987), Deniz Gül (1982), Alev Gözonar (1961), and Metin Tütün, in 2015; Hayal İncedoğan (1980), in 2016; Özge Yağcı (1983), in 2017; Ömer Dinler and Can Özal (1979), and in 2018; another installation work by Ardan Özmenoğlu.</p>
<p>Besides installations and video art, Taviloğlu's interest in lightboxes also dates back to the 2010s. In 2011, he added works by Ilgın Seymen (1980), Nazlı Eda Noyan (1974), Nermin Er (1972), and Çağrı Saray (1979); in 2012 by Bashir Barlakov (1977); in 2014 by Zekeriya Sarıbatur (1958) and Buğra Erol (1986) to his collection.</p>
<p>During the 2010s, the Taviloğlu Collection grew not only through the addition of photographs, videos, and installations but also through many mixed-media works.</p>

<blockquote><p>Mustafa Taviloğlu expresses his art collecting experience of more than forty years in the following words. 'When I started buying paintings for the first time in 1972, I did not know that I was starting a collection that would become an important part of my life in the future. At that time, there was not yet a painting market like today. Therefore, no one saw painting as an investment instrument.</p></blockquote>
<p>I loved painting, I loved the artist and with an amateur enthusiasm, I chose the paintings of artists I knew and with whom I had established a friendship. While doing this, the idea of 'value increase' never entered my mind for a moment. Today, a quarter of a century later, I have no other thoughts and intentions than my love and excitement for art in those days, and I am happy about it.'</p></div>
